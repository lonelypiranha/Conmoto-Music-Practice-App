# My Personal Project

## Project Description

I plan on making a **music practice journal app**. The app allows the user to **log** their **practice sessions** into the app and track their **practice duration, tempo, bars practiced, overall mastery, mood and focus** during their practice sessions. The app also allows the user to **add songs** that they are practicing into a **song library**, and they can see their **progress** (in terms of bars practiced, tempo, and overall mastery) on each song. The user will also be able to see the **overall statistics** of their mood, focus, and practice duration throughout the week.

This app will be used by **musicians** and **people who play a musical instrument/sing** who want to keep track of their progress on songs they are practicing. This project is interesting to me because I play the piano myself and I often wish there was an app that could help keep track of my progress on pieces that I'm practicing. I want to keep track of how long I practiced, which bars I practiced, at what tempo, and the overall mastery of the song I am practicing since these information are very useful for me to **structure my future practice sessions.**

## User Stories
